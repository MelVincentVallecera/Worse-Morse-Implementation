Implementation of Worse-Morse.

## Description

Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks
that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. It is named
for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. The International Morse Code encodes the ISO
basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and
procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and
"dashes", or "dits" and "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. (Wikipedia.org, 2017)
